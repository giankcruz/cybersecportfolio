# Incident report: Network hardening

Network hardening analysis allows for the identification and mitigation of vulnerabilities that could be exploited to compromise the security and confidentiality of corporate data. In this activity, a scenario will be addressed in which a social media organization has recently suffered a significant data breach caused by undetected vulnerabilities in its network infrastructure.

The goal will be to identify some common network hardening tools that can be implemented to improve the organization’s overall security. Subsequently, a specific vulnerability present in the company will be selected, and different network hardening methods will be proposed to address it. Finally, it will be explained how the chosen methods and tools will be effective in controlling this vulnerability and preventing future security breaches, thus ensuring the continuous protection of the organization’s assets and services.

## Scenario

You are a security analyst working for a social media organization. The organization recently experienced a major data breach, which compromised the safety of their customers’ personal information, such as names and addresses. Your organization wants to implement strong network hardening practices that can be performed consistently to prevent attacks and breaches in the future. 

After inspecting the organization’s network, you discover four major vulnerabilities. The four vulnerabilities are as follows:

1. The organization’s employees' share passwords.
2. The admin password for the database is set to the default.
3. The firewalls do not have rules in place to filter traffic coming in and out of the network.
4. Multifactor authentication (MFA) is not used. 

If no action is taken to address these vulnerabilities, the organization is at risk of experiencing another data breach or other attacks in the future. 

## Analysis: 
### Section 1: Select up to three hardening tools and methods to implement

1. Password policies: Employees share passwords, and the system administrator password is set to its default value.
2. Multifactor authentication: MFA is not used.
3. Firewall maintenance y Port filtering: Firewalls do not filter traffic or establish appropriate rules.

### Section 2: Explain your recommendations
1. Establishing and enforcing strong password policies, combined with the use of hashing and salting, dramatically reduces the risk of weak or shared passwords. It forces each user to manage their own strong credentials and makes brute force attacks or the abuse of shared accounts more difficult.
2. Adding MFA significantly increases account security. Even if an attacker obtains a password, they would need a second factor (e.g., a temporary code on a mobile device) to gain access. This mitigates both the problem of default passwords and password sharing.
3.  Implementing regular maintenance and filtering rules on firewalls limits malicious or unauthorized traffic, reducing the attack surface and preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data from outside the network..
