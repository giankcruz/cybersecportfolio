# Incident report: NIST CSF to respond to a security incident

Network incident analysis and response are essential for the security and continuity of business services. In this activity, the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF) will be used to analyze, document, and propose corrective actions for a network incident, reinforcing the security posture and aligning with international best practices. The application of the NIST CSF facilitates a structured risk management approach, improves communication with stakeholders, and promotes the continuous improvement of security controls. Additionally, the CSF is adaptable to different companies and scenarios, allowing procedures to be reused and customized. This report will demonstrate your skills in applying the NIST CSF and will serve as professional evidence in your portfolio at the end of the course.

## Scenario

You are a cybersecurity analyst working for a multimedia company that offers web design services, graphic design, and social media marketing solutions to small businesses. Your organization recently experienced a DDoS attack, which compromised the internal network for two hours until it was resolved.
During the attack, your organization’s network services suddenly stopped responding due to an incoming flood of ICMP packets. Normal internal network traffic could not access any network resources. The incident management team responded by blocking incoming ICMP packets, stopping all non-critical network services offline, and restoring critical network services. 
The company’s cybersecurity team then investigated the security event. They found that a malicious actor had sent a flood of ICMP pings into the company’s network through an unconfigured firewall. This vulnerability allowed the malicious attacker to overwhelm the company’s network through a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. 
To address this security event, the network security team implemented: 
A new firewall rule to limit the rate of incoming ICMP packets
Source IP address verification on the firewall to check for spoofed IP addresses on incoming ICMP packets
Network monitoring software to detect abnormal traffic patterns
An IDS/IPS system to filter out some ICMP traffic based on suspicious characteristics
As a cybersecurity analyst, you are tasked with using this security event to create a plan to improve your company’s network security, following the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF). You will use the CSF to help you navigate through the different steps of analyzing this cybersecurity incident and integrate your analysis into a general security strategy:

1. Identify security risks through regular audits of internal networks, systems, devices, and access privileges to identify potential gaps in security. 
2. Protect internal assets through the implementation of policies, procedures, training and tools that help mitigate cybersecurity threats. 
3. Detect potential security incidents and improve monitoring capabilities to increase the speed and efficiency of detections. 
4. Respond to contain, neutralize, and analyze security incidents; implement improvements to the security process. 
5. Recover affected systems to normal operation and restore systems data and/or assets that have been affected by an incident.

## Analysis

### Summary
The company faced a total disruption of its network services due to a DDoS attack based on the massive sending of ICMP/ping packets from several compromised systems. This flood of echo requests caused services to become inaccessible. To resolve the situation, the cybersecurity team blocked the malicious traffic and suspended non-essential services, thereby restoring critical functions and containing the effects of the attack.

### NIST CSF 
| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| Identify |  An attacker launched an ICMP flood attack against the company, which caused the entire internal network to go out of service and interrupted critical operations. In this situation, it is essential to determine the compromised technological assets, the affected business processes, and the personnel who need access to the systems in order to take the necessary measures to ensure security, restore the network, and allow the normal operation to resume. | 
| Protect |  To strengthen the protection of assets after a cybersecurity incident, it is essential to implement an immediate action plan. This includes restricting the volume of ICMP packets through new firewall rules, adjusting the IDS/IPS to filter malicious traffic, reviewing access controls, training staff on the attack and preventive measures, verifying and updating data protection procedures, and keeping all systems updated to prevent vulnerabilities. |
| Detect | The cybersecurity team must constantly monitor network traffic to detect threats, configuring firewalls to check source IP addresses in ICMP packets, using tools like Wireshark or TCPdump to analyze possible spoofing, and employing SIEM and IDS systems to alert about unusual activities and anomalies that could compromise security. |
| Respond |  After implementing tools to detect threats, it is essential to have an incident response plan. In the event of an attack, containment should be prioritized by isolating affected devices and restoring critical services. Then, logs are analyzed to identify anomalies, the organization is informed, and all events are documented according to regulations. Finally, the process is reviewed to improve response and strengthen resilience against future incidents. |
| Recover |  After a DDoS attack via ICMP flooding, it is crucial to gather information to prioritize the restoration of critical devices and services. It is recommended to block ICMP traffic at the firewall and suspend non-essential services to reduce the impact and speed up recovery. Essential functions should be restored first, and once the threat is under control, the rest of the services can be reactivated. All these actions must be carried out according to a clear recovery plan and maintaining effective communication with staff and users. |
